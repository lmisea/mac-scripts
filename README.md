# MAC Scripts

Bash scripts created for the MAC organization at USB by **LP**.

## GL1-T1

For Task #1 of GL, the following scripts were created:

- [modules.sh](https://github.com/lmisea/mac-scripts/blob/main/modules.sh).
  This script is used to load and unload kernel modules.
- [references.sh](https://github.com/lmisea/mac-scripts/blob/main/references.sh).
  This script is used to create and delete references to files.
- [usb-log.sh](https://github.com/lmisea/mac-scripts/blob/main/usb-log.sh).
  This script is used to log USB connections and disconnections.

Please, note that in order to properly run **_usb-log.sh_**, you need to run [**_install-usb-log.sh_**](https://github.com/lmisea/mac-scripts/blob/main/install-usb-log.sh) first.
